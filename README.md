# FizzBuzz

Practice repo for implementing the classic FizzBuzz challenge with the TDD workflow.

## Requirements

FizzBuzz is one of the most famous coding exercises for beginners. It is a simple exercise but an excellent one to start learning the TDD flow with.

1. Write a “fizzBuzz” method that accepts a number as input and returns it as a String
2. For multiples of three return “Fizz” instead of the number
3. For the multiples of five return “Buzz”
4. For numbers that are multiples of both three and five return “FizzBuzz”.
